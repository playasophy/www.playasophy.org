## Playa Chili (from Ruben and Image Node)

The below is the 12-15 person recipe; scale as needed; rinse the beans if possible.

#### Ingredients
- 2 cans each red, white, and black beans
- 2 cans of corn
- 2 large cans tomatoes
- 2 onions
- olive oil
- spices to taste
- grated cheddar and jack
- large tub of sour cream
- 4 cups of brown rice
- Tortillas?

#### Directions
- Cook 4 cups brown rice in about 9 1/2 cups of water: boil, lower to a simmer, cover, cook about 45 minutes or until done.

- Chop and sauté the onions, add the canned stuff, spice to taste with chili, lots of cumin, maybe cayenne, simmer, simmer, until thick and delicious.

## Japanese Curry (from Geeber and Naomi)
#### Ingredients
- some meat (I think we used chicken breast?)
- some veggies (I think we used carrots, potatoes, and onions?)
- a healthy chunk of curry roux.

#### Directions
Seasoned to taste (usually needs lots of salt, IIRC) and served over white rice.

## Spicy fried potatoes - Kallisti style (from Geeber)
#### Ingredients and Directions
- Just get a bunch of russet or golden potatoes
- Cut into slices and then lengths so you get roughly french-fry-shaped pieces. The thinner the slices the faster it cooks so I usually aim for a half-centimeter, give or take.
- Heat a healthy dollop of vegetable oil in a pan, then add the potato strips.
- Put in seasoning, whatever you like but I usually used salt/pepper/cayenne and whatever else was handy and sounded good.
- Simmer over medium heat until the fries get soft - it can take a while and it might seem like nothings happening, but eventually they'll kinda suddenly become delicious.
- Serve with plenty of ketchup and hot sauce; cheese is good too, and bacon is always a plus.
- (Prep note: cutting the potatoes takes a long time and cooking them does too if you only have a couple pans/burners, so pipe-lining helps a lot.)

## Delicious simple sausages (from Geeber)

- tortillas
- ketchup/mustard/hot sauce

#### Directions

- Put in tortilla

## Curried Peanut Butter Instant Ramen (from Chris K)
#### Metadata
- Prep time: 30 minutes
- Serves: two to four
- Tastes: not bad

#### Ingredients
- several packets of insta-ramen, sans powdered broth packets
- one onion
- a bunch of garlic
- butter, ghee, or oil to cook the onion and garlic
- a few scoops of peanut butter
- vegetable broth paste (I use better than bouillon veggie paste at the recommended concentration)
- a handful of peanuts
- two or three eggs
- hot chili sauce/paste
- msg, to taste

#### Directions
- Start a few cups of water -- enough to cook all the ramen -- boiling in a separate pot.

- While the water is heating up, dice the onion and mice the garlic. Bring both to a simmer in a pool of butter in the large pot over a low flame.

- Once the water comes to a boil, dump it into the large pot with the garlic and onions. Also dump in the ramen, peanut butter, peanuts, and broth paste.

- Stir occasionally to prevent the noodles from burning onto the bottom of the pot. Keep stirring over low/low-medium heat until most of the water has evaporated or been absorbed into the mixture, which should begin to resemble a fleshy sludge. As the ramen cooks, mix in the curry powder and chili sauce until the whole thing turns nuclear orange and elicits mucus/tears/etc. 

- Once everything else is fully cooked, or very nearly fully cooked, mix the eggs in a separate bowl and dump them into the big pot. Stir frantically. The eggs should cook in under a minute. Kill the heat and keep stirring until the mixture is mostly homogenized.

- Top with MSG and serve.

- Bon appétit!
